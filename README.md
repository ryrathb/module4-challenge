Description: In this code, the user will be presented with a quiz in which they can start by pressing the start button. One the button is pressed, the user will be presented with 5 questions, each that have four multiple choice options. Only one of these options is correct, and depending on if the user selects it or not will affect its score and time they have left. After the 5 questions are answered, the user will have the option to save its high score so that it can be saved in local storage. The user can then restart the quiz, attempt it again and record the score so it can then be compared to the previous one.
